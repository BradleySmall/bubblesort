I remember back to first year college. Prof said, some day your boss will come to you at 3:15 and ask you to write a sort module and he will need it by 3:30. The answer to this was the bubble sort. the idea being that it might not be the most efficient or elegant sort module, but sure enough it is easy to write. I have been working in the industry since 1989 and to date, no one has ever asked me to write a sort routine. :) 

That said, I challenged myself to write one in 15 minutes, in python because I am trying to relearn python. It took a little longer than 15 minutes, but I did comment it, comply with pylint3 and pycodestyle. And I refactored it for modularity. 

Give it a shot, see if you can do it without looking it up. It is an awesome feeling when it works.
